# Interactive Form

This is a static HTML form made interactive with JavaScript.

When JS is active the form performs the following:
- The "Other" job role is hidden unless selected in the job role selection.
- T-shirt colors will render when the corresponding design is selected.
- The activity form renders the total and disables activities that occur at the same time.
- The payment area will show the corresponding information with type of payment selected.
- The form validates the name, email, activities, and credit card information before the form may be submitted.
- When email validation fails, the form displays different error messages.
  - Displays an error when a proper email address is not entered.
  - Displays an error when the email field becomes empty.
